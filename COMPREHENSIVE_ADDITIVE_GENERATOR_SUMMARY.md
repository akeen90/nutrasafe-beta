## 🎨 Content Quality Examples

### Example 1: Aspartame (Controversial Topic)
```
whatItIs: "An artificial sweetener made from two amino acids (aspartic acid and
phenylalanine), 200 times sweeter than sugar."

whereItComesFrom: "Synthesized in laboratories by chemically bonding aspartic acid
and phenylalanine (both protein building blocks) with a methyl ester group."

whyItsUsed: "Provides intense sweetness with almost no calories in diet soft drinks,
sugar-free gum, and low-calorie desserts."

keyPoints:
- 🔴 SEVERE: "DANGEROUS for people with PKU (phenylketonuria) - cannot metabolize phenylalanine"
- 🟠 HIGH: "WHO in 2023 classified it as 'possibly carcinogenic to humans' (Group 2B)"
- 🟢 INFO: "Breaks down in heat, so cannot be used in baking"
- 🟡 MEDIUM: "Some people report headaches and behavioral effects"
- 🟢 INFO: "Widely studied but remains divisive among scientists"

fullDescription: (1,232 characters)
"Aspartame (E951/NutraSweet) was accidentally discovered in 1965 by chemist James
Schlatter researching ulcer drugs. When consumed, it breaks down into aspartic acid
(40%), phenylalanine (50%), and methanol (10%). People with phenylketonuria (PKU),
affecting 1 in 10,000-15,000 people, cannot metabolize phenylalanine, causing brain
damage - products must carry PKU warnings by law. In July 2023, WHO's International
Agency for Research on Cancer classified aspartame as Group 2B (possibly carcinogenic),
based on limited evidence from three studies linking high consumption to liver cancer.
However, WHO's Joint Expert Committee on Food Additives maintained safe intake at
40mg/kg body weight daily. This dual message confused consumers. A 330ml diet soda
contains about 180mg aspartame, so a 70kg person would need 15+ cans daily to exceed
limits. It's unstable in heat and acidic liquids, breaking down over time. Some people
report headaches, dizziness, or mood changes, but controlled blind trials often fail
to reproduce these effects. FDA approved it in 1981 after contentious review. Despite
40+ years of use and hundreds of studies, controversy persists. Many brands switched
to sucralose or stevia due to consumer backlash."
```

### Example 2: Tartrazine (Color Additive)
```
whatItIs: "A synthetic lemon-yellow azo dye, one of the most widely used artificial
food colorings worldwide."

whereItComesFrom: "Synthesized from coal tar derivatives through diazotization and
coupling reactions involving phenylhydrazine-p-sulfonic acid and diketosuccinic acid."

keyPoints:
- 🟠 HIGH: "Member of 'Southampton Six' - linked to hyperactivity in some children (EU warning required)"
- 🟠 HIGH: "Can trigger allergic reactions, hives, and asthma (especially aspirin-sensitive)"
- 🟠 HIGH: "Banned in Norway and Austria"
- 🟡 MEDIUM: "Estimated 1 in 10,000 people react adversely"
- 🟢 INFO: "Most widely tested food dye - extensive safety data"

fullDescription: (1,326 characters with specific details about Southampton study 2007,
FDA regulations, metabolic pathway, product examples like Mountain Dew and Gatorade,
Kraft reformulation 2016, etc.)
```

### Example 3: Sodium Benzoate (Preservative Controversy)
```
keyPoints:
- 🟠 HIGH: "Can form benzene (known carcinogen) when combined with vitamin C and heat/light"
- 🟠 HIGH: "Multiple product recalls (Fanta, Sunkist) for excessive benzene levels 2005-2010"
- 🟡 MEDIUM: "May trigger asthma and hives in aspirin-sensitive individuals"
- 🟡 MEDIUM: "Some studies link to hyperactivity in children (Southampton study additive)"
- 🟢 INFO: "FDA considers it safe at current levels (0.1% maximum)"

fullDescription: Includes specific benzene formation chemistry, 2005-2010 recall details,
EPA drinking water limits (5 ppb), reformulation strategies (EDTA addition), metabolic
pathway (hippuric acid conversion), Southampton study inclusion, real product examples.
```
