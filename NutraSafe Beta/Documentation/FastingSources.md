# Fasting Timeline: Scientific Sources

This document provides peer-reviewed scientific sources that back up the claims made in the fasting feature of NutraSafe.

## Overview

All timeline claims are based on general physiological responses observed in fasting studies. Individual responses may vary based on factors including metabolic health, diet composition, activity level, and fasting experience.

## Phase 1: Post-Meal Processing (0-4 hours)

**Claim**: "Body processing recent meal"

**Explanation**: During the first few hours after eating, blood glucose levels rise and insulin is released to facilitate glucose uptake by cells. The body is primarily using recently consumed nutrients for energy.

---

## Phase 2: Fuel Switching (4-8 hours)

**Claim**: "Transitioning to fat burning"

**Explanation**: As blood glucose levels decline and insulin levels drop, the body begins transitioning from primarily using glucose to utilising stored fat for energy. Glycogen stores start to deplete.

## Phase 3: Fat Mobilisation (8-12 hours)

**Claim**: "Fat stores being utilised"

**Explanation**: After approximately 8-12 hours of fasting, hepatic glycogen stores become substantially depleted, and the body increases lipolysis (fat breakdown) to provide energy substrates.

**Sources**:
- Klein, S., Sakurai, Y., Romijn, J. A., & Carroll, R. M. (1993). "Progressive alterations in lipid and glucose metabolism during short-term fasting in young adult men." *American Journal of Physiology*, 265(5 Pt 1), E801-E806.

## Phase 4: Mild Ketosis (12-16 hours)

**Claim**: "Mild ketone production"

**Explanation**: As fasting continues beyond 12 hours, ketone body production (ketogenesis) increases in the liver from fatty acid oxidation. Blood ketone levels begin to rise, though typically remain at mild levels during intermittent fasting.

**Sources**:
- Cahill, G. F., & Veech, R. L. (2003). "Ketoacids? Good medicine?" *Transactions of the American Clinical and Climatological Association*, 114, 149-163.

## Phase 5: Autophagy Potential (16-20 hours)

**Claim**: "Cellular cleanup may begin"

**Explanation**: Extended fasting (typically 16+ hours) may trigger autophagy, a cellular recycling process where cells break down and recycle damaged components. However, the exact timing and extent of autophagy induction in humans during intermittent fasting is still being researched.

**Note**: The language used is intentionally cautious ("may begin," "potential") as the exact timing and extent of autophagy in humans during intermittent fasting requires more research. Most direct evidence comes from animal studies.

## Phase 6: Deep Adaptive Fasting (20+ hours)

**Claim**: "Extended fasting benefits"

**Explanation**: Prolonged fasting beyond 20 hours may lead to more pronounced metabolic adaptations, including increased ketone production, enhanced autophagy, changes in hormone levels, and continued fat oxidation.

## Important Disclaimers

**Individual Variation**: The timelines provided are general guidelines based on average physiological responses. Actual metabolic transitions can vary significantly based on:
- Individual metabolic rate and health status
- Previous meal composition (particularly carbohydrate content)
- Activity level and muscle mass
- Fasting experience and metabolic flexibility
- Genetic factors

**Medical Consultation**: Users with medical conditions, pregnant or breastfeeding women, children, and individuals with eating disorders should consult healthcare providers before beginning any fasting regimen.

**Evidence Quality**: While there is substantial evidence for the metabolic changes during fasting, much of the research on specific health benefits comes from animal studies or observational human studies. More randomized controlled trials in humans are needed to fully understand all effects.

**App Disclaimer**: NutraSafe provides educational information about fasting but does not provide medical advice. The app is designed to help users track their fasting patterns, not to diagnose, treat, or prevent any disease.
