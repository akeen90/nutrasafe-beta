## 📚 Real Examples

### Example 1: High-Risk Sweetener (Aspartame)

```
E951 (Aspartame) ──────────────────────── 🔴

What I need to know:
🔴 DANGEROUS for people with PKU (phenylketonuria) - cannot
   metabolize phenylalanine
🟠 WHO in 2023 classified it as 'possibly carcinogenic to
   humans' (Group 2B)
🟢 Breaks down in heat, so cannot be used in baking
🟡 Some people report headaches and behavioral effects
🟢 Widely studied but remains divisive among scientists

▼ Scientific Background

Aspartame (E951/NutraSweet) was accidentally discovered
in 1965 by chemist James Schlatter researching ulcer drugs.
When consumed, it breaks down into aspartic acid (40%),
phenylalanine (50%), and methanol (10%). People with
phenylketonuria (PKU), affecting 1 in 10,000-15,000 people,
cannot metabolize phenylalanine, causing brain damage -
products must carry PKU warnings. In 2023, WHO's
International Agency for Research on Cancer classified
aspartame as Group 2B (possibly carcinogenic), based on
limited evidence from three studies...
```

### Example 2: Controversial Color (Tartrazine)

```
E102 (Tartrazine) ─────────────────────── 🟠

What I need to know:
🟠 Member of 'Southampton Six' - linked to hyperactivity
   in some children (EU warning required)
🟠 Can trigger allergic reactions, hives, and asthma in
   sensitive individuals (especially aspirin-sensitive)
🟠 Banned in Norway and Austria
🟡 Estimated 1 in 10,000 people react adversely
🟢 Most widely tested food dye - extensive safety data

▼ Scientific Background

Tartrazine (E102/Yellow 5) is a synthetic azo dye derived
from coal tar. It's one of the 'Southampton Six' - a 2007 UK
study found mixtures of certain dyes including tartrazine
increased hyperactivity in some children. This led to EU
requiring warning labels: 'may have an adverse effect on
activity and attention in children.' Norway and Austria ban
it entirely. Can trigger reactions in aspirin-sensitive
people due to similar chemical structures...
```

### Example 3: Insect-Derived Color (Cochineal)

```
E120 (Cochineal/Carmine) ──────────────── 🔴

What I need to know:
🔴 Made from 70,000 crushed female cochineal insects
   (scale bugs on cactus)
🔴 Can cause severe allergic reactions including anaphylaxis
   in some people
🟠 NOT suitable for vegans or vegetarians
🟢 One of the most color-stable natural reds - doesn't fade
🟢 Used since Aztec times - valued more highly than gold
   in 1500s

▼ Scientific Background

Cochineal (E120/carmine) is made from tiny scale insects
that live on prickly pear cactus. About 70,000 dried female
insects are crushed to produce 500 grams of dye. The Aztec
and Maya civilizations valued it more highly than gold.
Today, Peru produces 85% of the world's supply. The insects
produce carminic acid as a chemical defense mechanism...
```

### Example 4: Natural & Safe (Curcumin)

```
E100 (Curcumin) ───────────────────────── 🟢

What I need to know:
🟢 Generally recognized as safe - consumed as spice for
   thousands of years
🟢 Poor color stability - fades in light and alkaline
   conditions
🟢 May have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant health
   benefits (though food levels are low)
🟡 Can cause allergic reactions in sensitive individuals
🟢 Extraction often uses hexane (petroleum solvent) -
   not always 'natural' as marketed

▼ Scientific Background

Curcumin (E100) is natural yellow-orange pigment from
turmeric root (Curcuma longa), used both as spice and
food coloring. It's been used in Indian cooking for over
4,000 years. While marketed as 'natural', commercial
extraction uses hexane (petroleum solvent) to isolate
curcumin from dried turmeric...

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

### Emotion-First Language

We follow NutraSafe's premium onboarding aesthetic:

**Not:** "E102 is a synthetic color that may cause reactions"
**But:** "Can trigger hives and asthma in sensitive individuals"

**Not:** "Derived from insects"
**But:** "Made from 70,000 crushed female cochineal insects"

**Not:** "Regulatory concerns exist"
**But:** "WHO classified as 'possibly carcinogenic' in 2023"

### Glanceable Understanding

Users should understand the key facts in **3 seconds** by scanning colored bullets:

1. **Red bullets** = Stop and read carefully (danger/bans)
2. **Orange bullets** = Pay attention (warnings/concerns)
3. **Yellow bullets** = Be aware (cautions for some)
4. **Green bullets** = Context and facts (generally safe)

### Progressive Disclosure

1. **Collapsed:** Just the additive name + risk dot
2. **Expanded:** "What I need to know" (always visible)
3. **Deep dive:** Tap "Scientific Background" for full context

## 🗂️ Database Structure

### JSON Format

```json
{
  "name": "Aspartame",
  "eNumbers": ["E951"],
  "whatItIs": "An artificial sweetener made from...",
  "whereItComesFrom": "Synthesized in laboratories by...",
  "whyItsUsed": "Provides intense sweetness with...",
  "keyPoints": [

### Swift Implementation

Your existing `AdditiveRedesignedViews.swift` already handles this perfectly:

```swift
// Severity color mapping
func severityColor(_ severity: String) -> Color {
    switch severity {
    case "severe": return .red
    case "high": return .orange
    case "medium": return .yellow
    case "info": return .green
    default: return .gray
    }
}

// Bullet point display
ForEach(additive.keyPoints, id: \.text) { point in
    HStack(alignment: .top, spacing: 8) {
        Circle()
            .fill(severityColor(point.severity))
            .frame(width: 6, height: 6)
            .padding(.top, 6)
        Text(point.text)
            .font(.system(size: 14))
    }
}
```

## 💡 Philosophy

### We Give Facts, Not Prescriptions

**Not:** "You should avoid this"
**But:** "Banned in Norway and Austria - EU requires warning labels"

**Not:** "This is safe"
**But:** "Generally recognized as safe - consumed for thousands of years"

**Not:** "Dangerous chemical"
**But:** "WHO classified as 'possibly carcinogenic' in 2023 based on limited evidence"

### Truth Over Reassurance

If something is made from 70,000 crushed insects, we say so.
If WHO classified it as possibly carcinogenic in 2023, we say so.
If it's banned in multiple countries, we say so.
If it's generally safe with thousands of years of use, we say so.

**Users deserve honesty, not marketing.**
