## 🛠️ Technical Checklist

### Firebase Hosting Configuration

Recommended `firebase.json` settings for SEO:

```json
{
  "hosting": {
    "public": "public",
    "cleanUrls": true,
    "trailingSlash": false,
    "headers": [
      {
        "source": "**/*.@(jpg|jpeg|gif|png|webp)",
        "headers": [
          {
            "key": "Cache-Control",
            "value": "max-age=31536000"
          }
        ]
      },
      {
        "source": "**/*.@(css|js)",
        "headers": [
          {
            "key": "Cache-Control",
            "value": "max-age=604800"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### robots.txt Review

Current robots.txt is good. Blocks admin pages whilst allowing important content.

**Consider adding:**
```
User-agent: GPTBot
Disallow: /
```
(If you don't want AI crawlers indexing content for training)
