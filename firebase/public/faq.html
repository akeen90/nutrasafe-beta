Popular methods include 16:8 (fast 16 hours, eat within 8 hours), 18:6 (fast 18 hours, eat within 6 hours), and 5:2 (eat normally 5 days, restrict calories 2 days). During fasting periods, you consume only water, black coffee, or plain tea."

After 12-14 hours without food, insulin levels drop and the body begins accessing fat stores. Some research suggests IF may improve insulin sensitivity, reduce inflammation, and support cellular repair processes. Most people find the 16:8 method easiest to maintain long-term."

For example, if you finish dinner at 8pm, you wouldn't eat again until noon the next day. During the 16-hour fast, you can drink water, black coffee, and plain tea. This is the most popular intermittent fasting method because it's relatively easy — most of the fasting happens while you sleep."

                    <p>Food additives are substances added to food during manufacturing to preserve freshness, enhance flavour, improve texture, or add colour. In the UK and EU, approved additives are given E-numbers. Common types include preservatives, colourings, sweeteners, emulsifiers and flavour enhancers.

                    <p>E-numbers are codes assigned to food additives approved for use in the UK and EU. The 'E' stands for Europe. Each number identifies a specific additive: E100-199 are colours, E200-299 are preservatives, E300-399 are antioxidants, E400-499 are thickeners and emulsifiers, E600-699 are flavour enhancers, and E900-999 include sweeteners. For example, E300 is vitamin C and E322 is lecithin.</p>

                    <p>All food additives approved in the UK have undergone safety testing by regulatory bodies. Most are safe for the general population when consumed in normal amounts. However, some people may be sensitive to certain additives. Artificial colours (E102, E110, E122, E124, E129) have been linked to hyperactivity in some children. Sulphites (E220-228) can trigger reactions in asthmatics. If you have concerns, check ingredient labels or use a food scanner.</p>

                    <p>Ultra-processed foods (UPFs) are industrial formulations made mostly from substances extracted from foods or synthesised in laboratories. They typically contain ingredients you wouldn't find in a home kitchen: emulsifiers, humectants, flavour enhancers, and colours. Examples include soft drinks, packaged snacks, instant noodles, chicken nuggets, and many ready meals. Research links high UPF consumption to various health concerns.</p>

                    <p>Intermittent fasting (IF) is an eating pattern that cycles between periods of fasting and eating. Unlike diets that restrict what you eat, IF focuses on when you eat. Popular methods include 16:8 (fast 16 hours, eat within 8 hours), 18:6 (fast 18 hours, eat within 6 hours), and 5:2 (eat normally 5 days, restrict calories 2 days). During fasting periods, you consume only water, black coffee, or plain tea.</p>

                    <p>During fasting, your body exhausts its sugar stores and starts burning fat for energy — a process called metabolic switching. After 12-14 hours without food, insulin levels drop and the body begins accessing fat stores. Some research suggests IF may improve insulin sensitivity, reduce inflammation, and support cellular repair processes. Most people find the 16:8 method easiest to maintain long-term.</p>

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>16:8 fasting means you fast for 16 hours and eat all your meals within an 8-hour window. For example, if you finish dinner at 8pm, you wouldn't eat again until noon the next day. During the 16-hour fast, you can drink water, black coffee, and plain tea. This is the most popular intermittent fasting method because it's relatively easy — most of the fasting happens while you sleep.</p>

                    <p>Anything with calories technically breaks a fast. This includes food, sugary drinks, milk in coffee, and most supplements. What doesn't break a fast: water, black coffee, plain tea (no milk or sugar), and zero-calorie drinks. Some people allow small amounts of calories (under 50) without significantly impacting fasting benefits, but strict fasting means zero calories during your fasting window.</p>

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Intermittent fasting is generally safe for healthy adults. However, it's not suitable for everyone. You should avoid IF or consult a doctor if you: are pregnant or breastfeeding, have diabetes or blood sugar issues, have a history of eating disorders, are underweight, are under 18, or take medications that require food. Start gradually and listen to your body. Stop if you feel unwell.</p>

                    <p>Macros (macronutrients) are the three main nutrients your body needs in large amounts: protein, carbohydrates, and fats. Protein builds and repairs muscle (4 calories per gram). Carbohydrates provide energy (4 calories per gram). Fats support hormones and absorb vitamins (9 calories per gram). 'Counting macros' means tracking how much of each you eat, often to specific ratios like 40% carbs, 30% protein, 30% fat.</p>

                    <p>Calorie needs vary by age, sex, weight, height, and activity level. General UK guidelines suggest around 2,000 calories daily for women and 2,500 for men to maintain weight. To lose weight, you need a calorie deficit (eating less than you burn). To gain weight, you need a surplus. Use a TDEE (Total Daily Energy Expenditure) calculator for a personalised estimate, or consult a nutritionist.</p>

                    <p>UK food labels must show: ingredients (listed by weight, highest first), allergens (in bold), nutrition information per 100g and often per serving, and traffic light colours for fat, saturates, sugar and salt. Check the 'per 100g' column to compare products fairly. High is red (limit these), medium is amber, low is green. Also check serving sizes — they're often smaller than you'd actually eat.</p>

                    <p>You can track food using: a written food diary (note everything you eat and drink), a smartphone app with barcode scanning for quick logging, or photos of your meals. For best results, track in real-time rather than trying to remember later, include drinks and snacks, note portion sizes, and be honest — tracking works best when it's accurate. Apps like NutraSafe can scan barcodes to log food instantly.</p>

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>A food allergy involves the immune system and can be life-threatening. Symptoms appear quickly (minutes to hours) and can include hives, swelling, breathing difficulties, and anaphylaxis. Even tiny amounts trigger reactions. Food intolerance doesn't involve the immune system and isn't life-threatening. Symptoms are usually digestive (bloating, cramps, diarrhoea) and appear more slowly. You can often tolerate small amounts.</p>

                    <p>Common signs of food intolerance include bloating, stomach pain, diarrhoea, gas, nausea, and headaches after eating certain foods. To identify triggers: keep a food diary noting what you eat and any symptoms; try an elimination diet (remove suspected foods for 2-4 weeks, then reintroduce one at a time); or consult your GP. Note that home intolerance tests are often unreliable — proper diagnosis requires medical guidance.</p>
