        <h1>Stuck on a Plateau? 12 Hidden Reasons You're Not Losing Weight</h1>
        <div class="meta">Published January 2026 • 10 min read • Weight Loss</div>

        <div class="quick-answer">
            <h3>Quick Answer</h3>
            <p><strong>Most common reasons:</strong> Underestimating portions (eyeballing instead of weighing), not tracking on weekends, forgetting liquid calories, and eating back all exercise calories. Fix these 4 and you'll likely break through your plateau.</p>
        </div>

        <p>You're tracking every meal, staying within your calorie target, and exercising regularly — but the scales aren't moving. Sound familiar?</p>

        <p>Weight loss plateaus are frustrating, but they're almost always caused by <strong>hidden calorie tracking errors</strong>, not "broken metabolism" or "starvation mode." This guide reveals the 12 most common mistakes and shows you exactly how to fix them.</p>

        <h2>The 12 Biggest Calorie Counting Mistakes (And How to Fix Them)</h2>

        <div class="mistake-card">
            <h3>1. Not Weighing Food (Eyeballing Portions)</h3>

            <p><strong>The mistake:</strong> Guessing portion sizes instead of using kitchen scales. "That looks like 100g of chicken" or "about 2 tablespoons of peanut butter."</p>

            <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Studies show people underestimate portions by <strong>20-40%</strong> when eyeballing. That "100g" chicken breast is probably 150g. Those "2 tablespoons" of peanut butter are closer to 4.</p>

            <p><strong>The impact:</strong> If you're 30% off on all portions, eating 2,000 calories could actually be 2,600 — a 600-calorie surplus!</p>

            <div class="fix-box">
                <strong>Fix:</strong> Buy digital kitchen scales (£10-15 on Amazon). Weigh everything for 2 weeks minimum to learn true portion sizes. Even if you eventually go back to estimating, you'll be calibrated.
            </div>

            <p><strong>Common culprits:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Peanut butter (1 tablespoon = 16g = 95 calories, but people pour 40g = 240 calories)</li>
                <li>Cheese (eyeballed 30g often turns out to be 70g)</li>
                <li>Cooking oils (1 tablespoon = 120 calories, easy to add 3-4 tablespoons while cooking)</li>
                <li>Nuts (handful varies wildly, 20g vs 50g = 100 vs 300 calories)</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="mistake-card">
            <h3>2. Not Tracking on Weekends</h3>

            <p><strong>The mistake:</strong> Being strict Monday-Friday, then relaxing Saturday-Sunday. "I deserve a break" or "I'll get back on track Monday."</p>

            <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Weekend overeating wipes out your weekly deficit.</p>

            <p><strong>The maths:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Monday-Friday: 500 calorie deficit = -2,500 calories</li>
                <li>Saturday-Sunday: 1,000 calorie surplus each day = +2,000 calories</li>
                <li><strong>Weekly result: Only -500 calories = 0.07kg loss per week (should be 0.5kg)</strong></li>
            </ul>

            <div class="fix-box">
                <strong>Fix:</strong> Track weekends just as carefully as weekdays. If you want flexibility, use a "weekly calorie budget" instead of daily — save 100 calories Mon-Fri to bank 500 calories for Saturday indulgence.
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="mistake-card">
            <h3>3. Forgetting Liquid Calories</h3>

            <p><strong>The mistake:</strong> Not logging drinks — coffee with milk, juice, alcohol, fizzy drinks, smoothies.</p>

            <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Liquid calories add up fast and don't fill you up like solid food.</p>

            <p><strong>Common offenders:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Large latte: 220 calories</li>
                <li>Pint of lager: 180 calories</li>
                <li>Glass of wine (250ml): 200 calories</li>
                <li>Orange juice (250ml): 110 calories</li>
                <li>Bottle of wine: 600 calories</li>
                <li>Smoothie (shop-bought): 200-400 calories</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Two lattes + orange juice + wine with dinner = 730 calories you might not be tracking.</p>

            <div class="fix-box">
                <strong>Fix:</strong> Log everything liquid. Switch to black coffee, diet fizzy drinks, or sparkling water. If you drink alcohol, budget calories for it in advance.
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="mistake-card">
            <h3>4. Eating Back All Exercise Calories</h3>

            <p><strong>The mistake:</strong> Gym machines or fitness trackers say you burned 500 calories, so you eat an extra 500 calories that day.</p>

            <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Fitness trackers and gym equipment overestimate calorie burn by <strong>20-30%</strong>.</p>

            <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Treadmill says: 500 calories burned</li>
                <li>Actual calories burned: 350 calories</li>
                <li>You eat back: 500 calories</li>
                <li><strong>Result: +150 calorie surplus</strong></li>
            </ul>

            <div class="fix-box">
                <strong>Fix:</strong> Only eat back 50% of exercise calories (or none if you're not hungry). Treat exercise as a bonus deficit, not a free meal ticket.
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="mistake-card">
            <h3>5. Not Adjusting Calories as You Lose Weight</h3>

            <p><strong>The mistake:</strong> Using the same calorie target from when you started, even though you've lost 5-10kg.</p>

            <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> A 90kg person burns more calories than an 80kg person. Your <a href="/tdee-bmr-calculator">TDEE</a> decreases as you lose weight.</p>

            <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>90kg person: TDEE = 2,400 calories</li>
                <li>80kg person: TDEE = 2,200 calories</li>
                <li>If you keep eating the same 1,900 calories, your deficit shrinks from -500 to -300</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="fix-box">
                <strong>Fix:</strong> Recalculate your TDEE every 5kg lost. Reduce daily calories by 50-100 to maintain your deficit. Use our <a href="/tdee-bmr-calculator">free TDEE calculator</a>.
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="mistake-card">
            <h3>6. Choosing Wrong Database Entries</h3>

            <p><strong>The mistake:</strong> Using user-submitted database entries that are wildly inaccurate. "Chicken breast - 1 serving" could be 100g or 300g depending on who added it.</p>

            <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Apps like MyFitnessPal rely on user-submitted data. Some entries are 50%+ wrong.</p>

            <div class="fix-box">
                <strong>Fix:</strong> Scan barcodes for packaged foods (100% accurate). For fresh foods, choose verified entries (green checkmark in MFP) or search "USDA chicken breast" for official data. Better: use <a href="/best-food-scanner-app-uk">UK food scanner apps</a> with verified databases.
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="mistake-card">
            <h3>7. Not Tracking "BLTs" (Bites, Licks, Tastes)</h3>

            <p><strong>The mistake:</strong> Not logging:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Tasting while cooking</li>
                <li>Finishing kids' meals</li>
                <li>Handful of crisps from partner's bag</li>
                <li>Nibbling while food prepping</li>
                <li>Free samples at supermarkets</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> These "tiny" bites add 200-400 calories/day you're not accounting for.</p>

            <div class="fix-box">
                <strong>Fix:</strong> Log every single thing. If you taste while cooking, add "50 calories misc" to your log. Be honest about finishing kids' leftovers (half a fish finger = 50 calories, but 3 fish fingers + chips = 300).
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="mistake-card">
            <h3>8. Weighing Cooked Food Instead of Raw</h3>

            <p><strong>The mistake:</strong> Weighing chicken, rice, or pasta after cooking and logging it as the raw weight.</p>

            <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Food weight changes when cooked due to water loss/gain. This throws off your calorie count.</p>

            <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>100g raw chicken = 165 calories (loses water when cooked, weighs ~75g)</li>
                <li>100g cooked chicken = 165 calories (was ~135g raw)</li>
                <li>If you log 100g cooked as "100g raw chicken," you're underestimating by ~35%</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="fix-box">
                <strong>Fix:</strong> Always weigh raw (meat, rice, pasta, oats). If you must weigh cooked, search for "cooked chicken breast" specifically in your app.
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="mistake-card">
            <h3>9. Trusting "Healthy" Restaurant Meals</h3>

            <p><strong>The mistake:</strong> Assuming restaurant salads, grilled chicken, or "light" options are low-calorie.</p>

            <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Restaurants use butter, oil, and sauces generously. A "healthy" grilled chicken salad can be 800+ calories.</p>

            <p><strong>Hidden calories:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Caesar salad: 600-800 calories (dressing = 300+ calories)</li>
                <li>Grilled chicken with sides: 700-900 calories (oil, butter on vegetables)</li>
                <li>Nando's "healthy" bowl: 500-700 calories (sauces, dressings)</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="fix-box">
                <strong>Fix:</strong> Look up menus online before going out. Ask for dressing on the side. Assume restaurant meals are 20-30% higher calories than you'd guess. Budget extra calories for eating out.
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="mistake-card">
            <h3>10. Forgetting Cooking Oils and Butter</h3>

            <p><strong>The mistake:</strong> Not logging the oil you cook with. "It's just a little oil in the pan."</p>

            <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> 1 tablespoon of oil = 120 calories. Most people pour 2-3 tablespoons when frying.</p>

            <p><strong>Example cooking session:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Scrambled eggs: 1 tbsp butter = 100 calories</li>
                <li>Stir fry: 2 tbsp oil = 240 calories</li>
                <li>Roasted vegetables: 1 tbsp olive oil = 120 calories</li>
                <li><strong>Total untracked: 460 calories</strong></li>
            </ul>

            <div class="fix-box">
                <strong>Fix:</strong> Measure oil with a tablespoon (don't pour straight from bottle). Log it. Use spray oil for minimal calories (5-10 per spray). Invest in non-stick pans to use less oil.
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="mistake-card">
            <h3>11. Overestimating Your Activity Level</h3>

            <p><strong>The mistake:</strong> Setting your activity level as "active" or "very active" when calculating TDEE, but actually being lightly active.</p>

            <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> This inflates your TDEE by 200-400 calories, so you eat too much.</p>

            <p><strong>Reality check:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Sedentary:</strong> Desk job, minimal walking</li>
                <li><strong>Lightly active:</strong> Desk job + 30 min exercise 3x/week</li>
                <li><strong>Active:</strong> Physical job OR desk job + gym 5x/week</li>
                <li><strong>Very active:</strong> Manual labour + gym daily</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="fix-box">
                <strong>Fix:</strong> Choose "sedentary" or "lightly active" for most people. Add exercise calories manually if needed. Better to underestimate than overestimate.
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="mistake-card">
            <h3>12. Not Tracking Consistently Long Enough</h3>

            <p><strong>The mistake:</strong> Giving up after 1-2 weeks when the scales don't move. "Calorie counting doesn't work for me."</p>

            <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Water weight fluctuations mask fat loss. You might lose 0.5kg of fat but retain 1kg of water (period, carbs, salt, inflammation) — scales show +0.5kg.</p>

            <p><strong>Timeline reality:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Week 1:</strong> Water weight loss (1-2kg) — NOT fat</li>
                <li><strong>Week 2-3:</strong> Water rebounds, scales plateau — fat loss IS happening</li>
                <li><strong>Week 4:</strong> True fat loss becomes visible (0.5-1kg total)</li>
                <li><strong>Week 8+:</strong> Consistent downward trend</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="fix-box">
                <strong>Fix:</strong> Track for minimum 4 weeks before judging results. Weigh yourself weekly (same day, same time). Focus on the trend, not daily fluctuations. Track measurements (waist, hips) too.
            </div>
        </div>

        <h2>How to Diagnose Your Specific Problem</h2>

        <p><strong>If you're not losing weight after 3+ weeks, follow this checklist:</strong></p>

        <ol>
            <li><strong>Week 1: Double-check portion accuracy</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Weigh EVERYTHING for 7 days (even things you "usually eyeball")</li>
                    <li>Compare your estimated portions to actual weights</li>
                    <li>Most people discover 200-500 hidden calories here</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li><strong>Week 2: Track EVERYTHING (including BLTs, drinks, weekends)</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Log every taste, every drink, every weekend meal</li>
                    <li>Be brutally honest</li>
                    <li>Most people find another 200-400 hidden calories</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li><strong>Week 3: Reduce calories by 10%</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>If you're truly eating your target and still not losing, reduce by 100-200 calories</li>
                    <li>Your TDEE might be lower than calculated</li>
                    <li>Some people have slower metabolisms due to genetics, thyroid, or previous dieting</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li><strong>Week 4: Check for medical issues</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>If still no progress, see your GP</li>
                    <li>Get thyroid checked (TSH, T3, T4)</li>
                    <li>Check for PCOS, insulin resistance, or other hormonal issues</li>

        <h2>The Truth About Metabolism and "Starvation Mode"</h2>

        <p><strong>Myth:</strong> "I'm in starvation mode — my body is holding onto fat because I'm eating too little."</p>

        <p><strong>Reality:</strong> Starvation mode doesn't exist in the way people think. Yes, metabolism slows slightly as you lose weight (~50-100 calories for every 10kg lost), but you don't "stop losing weight" because you're eating too little.</p>

        <p><strong>If you're not losing weight, you're eating at maintenance</strong> — not below it. The solution is to eat less or move more, not eat more.</p>

        <h2>Tools to Fix Your Tracking</h2>

        <p>Improve accuracy with these tools:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Digital kitchen scales:</strong> £10-15 on Amazon (absolute must-have)</li>
            <li><strong><a href="/best-food-scanner-app-uk">Food scanner app</a>:</strong> Scan UK barcodes for accurate data (NutraSafe, Nutracheck)</li>
            <li><strong>Measuring spoons:</strong> For oils, sauces, nut butters</li>
            <li><strong>TDEE calculator:</strong> Recalculate every 5kg lost (<a href="/tdee-bmr-calculator">use ours</a>)</li>
            <li><strong>Body tape measure:</strong> Track waist/hip measurements (sometimes fat loss shows here before scales)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>

        <p>If you're not losing weight despite "eating at a deficit," you're almost certainly making one of these 12 mistakes. The good news? They're all fixable.</p>

        <p><strong>Start with the top 4:</strong></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Weigh your food (stop eyeballing)</li>
            <li>Track weekends just as carefully as weekdays</li>
            <li>Log all liquid calories</li>
            <li>Don't eat back all exercise calories</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Fix these and you'll likely break through your plateau within 2 weeks. Weight loss is simple (calories in vs out) but precision matters. Small tracking errors compound into big problems.</p>
